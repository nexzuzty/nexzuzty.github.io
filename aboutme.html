      <h1>Hi i'm Terry.</h1>
    <p>This page is to discuss about who I am.</p>
    <p>I'm a student(currently) enrolled in Hillcrest Highschool. I use most of my time either studying, on my homework, or playing games on the computer. I have a passion for competitive games on the computer such as Overwatch, Counter Strike : Global Offensive, or even Starcraft II.</p>
    <p>This is just a small part of who I am. But if you ever desire to talk to me, go ahead, i'm always looking to make friends.</p>
